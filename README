=============================

SimpleHashSet.java  - A superclass for implementations of hash-sets implementing the SimpleSet interface.

OpenHashSet.java - represent open hash set.

ClosedHashSet.java - represent close hash set.

CollectionFacadeSet.java - Wraps an underlying Collection and serves to both simplify its API and give
it a common type with the implemented SimpleHashSets.

SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer.java - this function test the run time in different sets.

LinkedListWrapper.java - this class is wrapping the linked list to the open hash table.

RESULT - the result of the SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer.


=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
i made extra function to help bigger function in the OpenHashSet, ClosedHashSet, SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer
and SimpleHashSet.

SimpleHashSet:
raisingTable() - this function raise the table and increases or decreases the hash table.
addHelper() - this function helping to the add function.

ClosedHashSet:
same as SimpleHashSet.
note. thr the to function get different type in any class.

SimpleHashSet:
SizeCapacityRatio() - this function return the ratio between the size and the capacity.

SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer:
testForSets() - this function gets data and test all the 5 kind of set.
testContain() - this function test if the string is contain in the set.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
i have one problem in the close hash set, in some data is not working for more then 600
iterations, i have no idea way, i tried to debug that for days.

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================
How you implemented OpenHashSet’s table:
i made wrapper As we saw on the instructions of the exercise.

How you implemented the deletion mechanism in ClosedHashSet:
i run on the array and made null the string that i want to delete.

Discuss the results of the analysis in depth:
– Account, in separate, for OpenHashSet’s and ClosedHashSet’s bad results for data1.txt:
the open hash set is working for me much better, it take longer for she close hash set.

– Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each of the data structures as reflected by
the results. Which would you use for which purposes?
i believe in the open hash set cause it take less time.


– How did your two implementations compare between themselves?
as i say the open it better in my program.
